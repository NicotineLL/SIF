## Demo

## Description

Get an image feed from various social networks and art galleries:
- Instagram
- Tumblr
- WeHeartIt
- Pinterest
- Flickr
- DeviantArt
- Behance

note: Considering the extremely user unfriendly way oAuth works Facebook, Twitter and Dribbble are not a part of this plugin. However because of popular demand the only exception is Instagram.

## Installation

The script is using protocol-relative URLs to match secured and non-secured connections, so it requires web server to run

1. Download the master repository https://github.com/NicotineLL/sif/archive/master.zip
2. Unzip on your web server or localhost
3. Open feed.html
